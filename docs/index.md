Helperfunc is a collection of pretty useful functions that can be used anywhere, in any situation.

This documentation covers how to use each function, and how to install it.

## Installation:

You can do either of the code blocks below, depending if you use yarn or npm.

Yarn:

```bash
yarn add helperfunc
```

NPM:

```bash
npm install helperfunc
```

## What IS helperfunc? How is it useful?

Helperfunc is a collection of various functions I find important, if you want, you can call it a
library. These functions can be really useful, in any circumstance. You can use it with both
Typescript and Javascript, and it should run on the browser, and of course in NodeJS apps.
Because helperfunc is created with Typescript, you'll also get sweet definition intellisense
in your IDE. I plan to expand this a lot, adding more functions, and all that cool jazz.

## Individual functions

These are pieces of documentation about each function (in the latest version).
